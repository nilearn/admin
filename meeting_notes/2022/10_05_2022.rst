General points
--------------

- CZI grant:
    - `To-do list and material needed for this round <https://github.com/nilearn/Applications/tree/main/2022-CZI-EOSS-Cycle-5>`_
    - who is the grant's PI ?
    - what do we need in terms of official (University) support ?
    - We do not need letters from other partners projects (fitlins, MNE, ...)
- CircleCI:
    - we have bought a plan (currently working)
    - after discussing with the CircleCI people, there seems to be a free OSS plan (tbc)
    - opened issue (`#3239 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3239>`_)
- updates on Brainhack OHBM'22 
    - Hao-ting, Elizabeth attending in person, Bertrand virtually, Taylor (probably) virtually
    - Prepare labels for issues related to Brainhack (Hao-Ting can help Yasmin with this)

Open Issues and PRs
-------------------

-  Setting up nilearn development environment per instructions fails as tbb is not installed (`#3244 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3244>`_)
    -  Taylor: I think this is `mkl`'s fault, and I was unable to reproduce with `conda`, so it could be homebrew-specific as well. Do we even need `mkl`? It's a docs-specific requirement, and I don't know where it's used.
    -  Gael: Remove mkl dependency.
-  Issues when using matplotlib version 3.5.1 (`#3236 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3236>`_)
    -  Yasmin could not reproduce issue
    -  Will give another nudge to contributer to reproduce on public data 
- `0.9.1` tests fail with 4 `Assertion Errors` in `interfaces/fmriprep/tests/test_load_confounds.py` (`#3232 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3232>`_)
    - Hao-Ting: Rounding error? How to proceed with this kind of bug
        - Increase the length of the simulated signal
        - Investigate the collinearity of the confounds
- GLM+TFCE PR (`#3196 <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/3196>`_) may need one more review.
- There are several "multivariate" tests for `permuted_ols` that (1) are not multivariate and (2) are just duplicates of existing univariate tests. Would it be okay to remove them, or do we need to open an issue to fix them?
