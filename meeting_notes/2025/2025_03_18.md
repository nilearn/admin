## Issues

### 5249 - spam automated issue on the repo

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/5249

???

### 5209 - dead atlas?

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/5209

course of action when some atlas links die?

## PRs

[review required](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Review+required%22)

### 5234 - refactor nilearn.plotting package

Refactor "nilearn.plotting" package to create sub-packages for each object type and create separate backends for each plotting engine.

Two PR's for "nilearn.plotting.surface" and "nilearn.plotting.matrix"

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5234
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5240

These would further separate backends for matplotlib and plotly which would look like 

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5203

As all function imports are at "nilearn.plotting" level (with a few exceptions like						"nilearn.plotting.img_plotting.MNI152TEMPLATE" that would require deprecation), it would not have an impact for the users as far as I can imagine.

### 5224 - make surface utility functions public

are we OK to handle surface utility functions (mean_img, new_img_like...) with their volume counterpart?

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5224

### 5199 - drop python 3.9

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5199

I (Rémi) was thinking of dropping 3.9 a bit before its official end of life. Reasoning would be:

- we have one release [0.11.2](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/milestone/28) (given our semi regular release schedule) in the spring / early summer with normal 3.9 support
- check if a patch release is necessary soon after it for bug fixes
- after this, drop 3.9 since we won't have another release before its official EOL (AFAICT) (planned release after this would be [0.12.0](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/milestone/30))

advantage: removes 20% of our CI runs for at least a several months

note: apparently dropping to python 3.9, would make us bump to matplotlib 3.8 (just when it is recommended to drop support for it [SPEC0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/#recommend-drop-support-for-4) :shrug: ...)


### 5222 - add surface support to threshold_stats_img

why is "all-resolution-inference" mentioned in our code with no implementation?

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5222#discussion_r1998256742

### 4453 - improve display of report in notebooks

no footer or navbar for reports
