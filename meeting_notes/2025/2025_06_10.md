## News

- OHBM poster: himanshu
- OHBM hackathon: 
    - ideas: work on open issues?
    - work on an atlas comparator? https://github.com/Remi-Gau/atlas_comparator.git, an updated version of https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007200 
- update list of core dev?
    - https://nilearn.github.io/dev/authors.html#core-developers
    - see PR: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5429
- release 0.12: coming soon
    - milestone: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/milestone/28
    - do we want to delay till after OHBM hackathon to maybe include a couple more fix or contributions? Or actually try to finish it before to get some early feedback at hackathon?

## Issues

### 5408 - Misleading first level parameters logic

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/5408

Some first level model parameters are more data specific (TR, slice_time_ref...) and will be ignored if user passes design matrix at fit time.

#### problems

- sklearn 'recommends' that data specific info should be passed at fit time

from the sklearn doc: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html#fitting

> Depending on the nature of the algorithm, fit can sometimes also accept additional keywords arguments. However, any parameter that can have a value assigned prior to having access to the data should be an __init__ keyword argument. Ideally, fit parameters should be restricted to directly data dependent variables.

- not enough warnings / doc that those paramereters are ignored if design matrices are passed at fit time


Question: do we want to change the API, so that data specific parameters are passed at fit time ?

ACTION: no change in API, update doc and add warnings


## PRs

[review required](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Review+required%22)

### 5410 - [ENH] add tedana support for load_confounds

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5410

- should we aim to have it ready for 0.12?

### 5421 - [FIX] less warning when using symmetric_cmap with matplotlib engine and warn to use the proper 'hemi' when plotting surfaces

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5421

See related issue: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/5414

The PR would throw warning about the "hemi" when user want to plot surfaces by passing arrays for mesh and data: we cannot know what hemisphere is being passed in this case, so we warn the user to be cautious and double check what hemi they have passed.

#### problems

- we have never warned about this before even when we did not have any SurfaceImage
- warning fatigue leads to warnings being ignored
- this is about plotting functions so users should litteraly see when something is not right (or at least one would hope)
    
#### more general question

- should we start thinking about deprecating the possibility to plot numpy arrays directly?
    - Remi: not before we have an easy way to load files to SurfaceImage
    - Bertrand: would require deprecation

## Set time next meeting
