    - Is anything needed from the other devs ? @Remi

- About surface/image objects interfacing with nibabel:
    - nilearn.image module: why separate functions and not as object methods?
    - implement image operations under NiftiImage object and SurfaceImage?
    - nibabel's "surface image" implementation not moving forward due to lack of resources
