- Performance benchmarking with asv ([#5280](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5280))
- AAL atlas issue fixed itself

## Issues

- [#5300](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/5300): Use methods in SurfaceImage objects for checking equality, mean etc. ([relevant discussion](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5301#discussion_r2024375219))
    - two different kind of functions "checks between two images" vs. "image operations"
    - checks are only used by devs vs. image operations are used by public
    - add methods in the objects for devs and still keep user-facing image module
    - maintaining both would be difficult and would make structure complex
    - new situation that we developed SurfaceImage, to be added to nibabel
    - we still want to be "approachable"
    - re-connect with nibabel devs about SurfaceImage
    - [Elizabeth] bring up old discussions with nibabel devs
    - Hao-Ting's ancient unfinished [easter egg in nibabel](https://github.com/nipy/nibabel/pull/1014)
- [#5262](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5262): use `imgs` instead of `img` / `X` for `fit`, `transform`, `fit_transform`
    - Remi will look into it
- [#5128](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5128): User-guide page to introduce factors affecting performance
    - Elizabeth noted that order of calls affecting peakmem readings by `%memmit` ([comment](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5128#discussion_r2021769564))
    - probably due to numpy mem mapping
    - better to run each command in separate ipython instances
    - revisit [the example](https://nilearn.github.io/dev/auto_examples/07_advanced/plot_mask_large_fmri.html) comparing NiftiMasker's performance
    - trying to implement the comparison via ASV, but parallelization failing ([PR on an external repo](https://github.com/man-shu/nilearn_benchmarks/pull/1))
    - LATEST: works only with `threading` joblib backend:

## Other questions

* Organize a hackathon ?
* funding opportunities ? https://oscars-project.eu/
    * under life sciences
    * we dont exactly match the target, fall into "also funded" category
    * 10 page proposal: needs a lot of time
    * check with Bertrand, get some clarity this week
    * [Himanshu] send an email with everyone to get the said clarity.
