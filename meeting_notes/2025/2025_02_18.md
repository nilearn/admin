## Issues

### Niivue

- [Himanshu] benefits of Niivue over Plotly? Original [issue](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3451) and [PR](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/3729) don't mention any.
    - it might be memory efficient (to be checked)
    - consolidate plotting backend (eventually only having one)
    - can do 4D plotting (to be checked)
    - better contour lines in plotly: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/3949
- meeting mostly talked about: https://github.com/niivue/ipyniivue
- grants for support niivue ??

### Leave twitter

- no issue opened but I (Rémi) thought we could probably talk about it.
- ACTION: leave twitter and redirect to other platform
- post on mastodon

### Remove 'authors' from our modules

one exemple: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/02dd1f0a2cc45685ba6e9dbe818f4637a504ec82/nilearn/datasets/tests/test_atlas.py#L3

- why give more importance to the first few people and not the dozens of people who came after?
- if you want to know the full list of authors or who created it, git can tell you.
- Suggestions
  - ACTION: remove completely
  - ~~or replace by 'original authors'~~

### 4983 - add tables listing available atlases in nilearn

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4983

* work on it for next release

### Update on NiftiMasker memory

- [#5113](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5113) Example comparing mem usage for masking in parallel.
- Observed variation with _how_ images are provided (path vs. in memory object)
- For in memory case, diff between array image vs. proxy image when in parallel
- So I wanted to confirm for single: [no difference](https://output.circle-artifacts.com/output/job/629bd2c1-1eea-47eb-9a58-1ebbc51a61f7/artifacts/0/dev/auto_examples/07_advanced/plot_compare_img_loading_single.html), experimental PR [#5152](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5152)
- Conclusion: some interaction with joblib's parallel and/or with memory profiler
- Next steps: 
    - look further into interaction with joblib and what's the best way to do things parallely
    - NiftiMasker still performs worse than plain numpy masking (time AND memory): [comparison](https://output.circle-artifacts.com/output/job/629bd2c1-1eea-47eb-9a58-1ebbc51a61f7/artifacts/0/dev/auto_examples/07_advanced/plot_compare_img_loading_single.html)
    - compile other related issues previously
