What should be our priorities?

- Surface
  - see https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4889
  - support for CIFTI and representation for both surface and sub-cortical
  - related issue: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/2388
  - requires care about connectome WB compatibility
  - add to roadmap for 0.12.0
  - check with Chris M
- Atlas, datasets and label masker improvements
- Performance improvements
  - improve doc 
  - have example to show how to speed things up on a small data, related to #4811
- Refactor code for reporting
- Add type annotations
- Anything else?

### 3568 - Adding type annotation to nilearn

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/3568

A large chunk of the user facing API is annoted with stubs in here: https://github.com/Remi-Gau/nilearn-stubs

- sklearn is not doing type annotations
- revisit later

### Doc repo clean up

The repo of the doc is > 8Go. This is not OK!!!

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn.github.io/issues/4

- added a folder for most 'recent' stable releases: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn.github.io
- added tags for most of the 'recent' stable releases: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn.github.io/tags
- harder to do for older versions, but could do it.
- How much of the history of the doc do we want to keep? 
- TODO: start cleaning

### 4885 - Add function to compute framewise displacement

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4885

Still not in scope

## PRs

[PR that need reviews](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22Review+required%22)

### 4442 - Smoothing of surface data

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/3267

- how complex / flexible do we want the surface smoothing function to be?
- how well do we want to align with how other softwares (FreeSurfer) do their surface smoothing?
  - express smoothing with FWHM and convert to iterations internally
  - keep it simple and not necessaily aligned wxith FS

### 4442 - Add report to surface based GLMs

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/4442

- new layout for the report that will then be applied to the volume based GLMs reports

### 5041 - Refactor atlas

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5041

- adds a private class Atlas to help standardize what we should expect an atlas to contain

### 5032 - Add docstrings to test mass_univariate

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5032

- try to make sure all tests have a docstring

### 5031 - Update description nki

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5031

- improve general doc of our datasets

### 5027 - refactor tests nifti maps masker

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5027

- shorter and more independent tests

### 5045 - Pacify mypy

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/5045

- to be discussed
